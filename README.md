# Mule Migration Assistant

[![MMA Build Actions Status](https://github.com/mulesoft/mule-migration-assistant/workflows/Mule%20Migration%20Assistant%20Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mulesoft/mule-migration-assistant/actions)

Mule Migration Assistant is a command-line tool that helps migrate Mule 3.x applications to Mule 4.x. This tool works on a "best-effort" basis to translate every component in the base application. This means that if it does not complete 100% of the migration, manual adjustments are required. A migration report generated when the assistant is ran can help with those adjustments.

## Overview

In order to understand the tool, let's start with a couple of informal definitions:

- Task &#8594; a set of steps;
- Step &#8594; an operation that change/remove/update a resource or content that can be present in a project.

In simple terms, the tool executes a sequence of tasks over a project and outputs a migrated project and a report about the migration.

## Modules

* [Migration Archetype](./migration-contribution-archetype): Maven archetype generator for a new Migration Task contribution.
* [Migration API](./mule-migration-tool-api): Set of API's to use when developing a new Migration task.
* [Contributions](./mule-migration-tool-contribution): Where all external contributions are contributed to the tools. The set of migration tasks defined on this module will be loaded to the Migration Assistant trough SPI.
* [Expression Migrator](./mule-migration-tool-expression): MEL to DW migrator. It contains all the rules to migrate Mule 3 expressions defined on MEL to the new DW transformation language on Mule 4.
* [Migration Library](./mule-migration-tool-library): Set of default migrations that are shipped with the Mule Migration Assistant. It contains all the migrations of Mule Core components, MUnit, etc.
* [Engine](./mule-migration-tool-engine): The execution engine that identifies the project type, locate all the migration tasks available and performs the migration.
* [Runner](./runner): Console implementation to execute the Mule Migration Assistant.
* [Integration Tests](./mule-migration-tool-tests): Suite of tests to validate all the component that will be supported by this tool.
